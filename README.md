## Overview

FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) is a non-profit organization that describes itself as an international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer.
It is the highest governing body of association football.

We plan on introducing a Team Creation System, that allows players to use player's virtual characters in a customized team.
But there are many attributes that make a great player, not to forget goalkeepers and non-goalkeepers have an entirely different set of attributes.
Comparing more than 18000 players manually over 100+ attributes can be tedious and time-consuming.

Before diving deeper, it is necessary to lay out an upper-level analysis of some of the commonly interpreted attributes, which is the primary goal of this case study.

## The Challenge

In the world of virtual football, not all players are created equal. Attributes such as speed, skill, and endurance play a crucial role in a player's performance. Furthermore, goalkeepers have an entirely different set of attributes compared to outfield players. To create a winning team, it's essential to understand these attributes and how they contribute to a player's effectiveness on the virtual pitch.

## Key Goals

**Attribute Prioritization**: We seek to determine which player attributes are most influential in virtual matches. This analysis will help players focus on the attributes that truly matter.

**Team Optimization**: By understanding the importance of different attributes, we aim to assist players in building optimized teams that align with their playing style and strategy.

**Data-Driven Decisions**: We encourage data-driven decision-making in player selection, empowering gamers to make informed choices.

Our analysis encompasses the following key areas:

**In-Depth Attribute Analysis**: A comprehensive examination of player attributes, shedding light on their significance in virtual football.

**Dimensionality Reduction**: The use of advanced techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to identify the most critical attributes for predicting player valuation.

**Predictive Modeling**: Application of supervised models to determine which attributes have the greatest impact on overall player ratings and valuation.

**Match Outcome Predictions**: Integration of historical data to predict match outcomes based on player ratings, team compositions, locations, and other factors.

**Smart Player Selection**: Identification of the most relevant attributes through analysis, enabling players to make informed decisions when building their dream teams.
