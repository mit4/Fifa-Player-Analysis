# Overview
FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) is a non-profit organization that describes itself as an international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer.
It is the highest governing body of association football.

We plan on introducing a Team Creation System, that allows players to use player's virtual characters in a customized team.
But there are many attributes that make a great player, not to forget goalkeepers and non-goalkeepers have an entirely different set of attributes.
Comparing more than 18000 players manually over 100+ attributes can be tedious and time-consuming.

We will perform a general analysis and easily determine which attributes should they consider for player selections.
Before diving deeper, it is necessary to lay out an upper-level analysis of some of the commonly interpreted attributes, which is the primary goal of this case study.

## Data Descrption

**A high-level overview of the dataset:**

|Dataset| Records | Features | Dataset Size |

## Insights
Most of the analysis is in notebook.


Further analysis can be performed on this data.

We can use **PCA** or **LDA** to determine which **features are most important** and select those to predict a player's valuation.

Also, we can use a supervised model's feature importance to determine which features are useful for **overall rating** or **player valuation** prediction.

Past data can be integrated as well to determine match **winning predictions** based on **ratings**, **players**, **location**, etc.

This data can be used to **select a player** based on the right set of attributes.
